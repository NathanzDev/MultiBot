# MultiBot
Decided to make another one, because it didn't go that good with the bot. Be in a look out for it being sent in free-release. You can edit the bot and make it your own since it was kinda my rough draft. My discord is https://discord.gg/FEUeMSajnX , come check it out! Go check out Hyperz also https://discord.gg/hyperz

# Steps
1. Edit config.json file with your bot's token
2. When you have it in the code editor run command "npm i ascii-table" in the terminal.
3. Start up the bot with "node ." in the terminal
